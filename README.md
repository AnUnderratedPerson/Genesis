# Genesis

Testing Branch.

Genesis is some random programming language which was previously named 'Meta' or 'MetaLang'.
It uses codespaces also for editing so that's something cool and useful.

## Todo
- Utilities
    - [] Implement an internal formatter for strings and migrate from string streams.
    - [] Implement a core exception class for all exceptions created internally. Would make it really easier for the main file instead of constant try and catch blocks.
- Code Processing
    - [] Code processing is a testing feature similar to macros in C++ in a particular way. This will be explained more in-depth in a proposal file.
